Multithreading:
Multithreading is a way to achieve Multitasking.
There are two types:
i) Process based multi tasking:
When each independent task is a seperate process then it is called a Process based multi tasking.
eg: downloading a file from browser and watching a movie are 2 seperate independet tasks.

ii) Thread based multi tasking:
In thread based multitasking same program contains several tasks means threads and each thread is seperate independent part of the program and all the task executing simultaneously.
eg: suppose there are 2000 lines of code in a program, first 1000 lines of code perform seperate task while other 1000 lines seperate, hence both can run simultaneously in a code.

Applications of Multithreading:
1. Development of video games
2. Development of animation
3. In multimedia graphics
4. Development of web and server.

When we should go for multithreading?
Whenever we have independent task in our program that means there is no dependency between the tasks then there is no need to execute that one in order wise.
Every program is an independent part.

Main Thread:
Every python program consists of a default thread called as Main thread.
